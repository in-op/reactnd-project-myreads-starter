# MyReads Project

This React web app allows you to search books from the BooksAPI from Udacity and organize them
into one of three "shelves": _Currently Reading_, _Want to Read_, and _Read_.

## Quickstart

To get started developing right away:

* grab a copy of the source code
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* you're good to go!
